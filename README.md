# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Classification

### What Is Machine Learning ?

Machine learning which we will be referring as(ML), is a branch of artificial intel- ligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed. The primary goal of machine learning is to enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data

### Classification
Classification is one of the three branches of machine learning, where the algorithm is trained on labeled data, where each example is associated with a corresponding label or outcome. The goal is to learn a mapping from input features to output labels, enabling the algorithm to make predictions on new data.

### What Is Exploratory Data Analysis ?
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and inves- tigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods.
EDA helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.
EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. It can also help determine if the statistical techniques you are considering for data analysis are appropriate. Originally developed by American mathematician John Tukey in the 1970s, EDA techniques continue to be a widely used method in the data discovery process today.

### Why Exploratory Data Analysis Is Important ?
The main purpose of EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions. It can help identify obvious errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data, detect outliers or anomalous events, find interesting relations among the variables.
Data scientists can use exploratory analysis to ensure the results they produce are valid and applicable to any desired business outcomes and goals. EDA also helps stakeholders by confirming they are asking the right questions. EDA can help answer questions about standard deviations, categorical variables, and con- fidence intervals. Once EDA is complete and insights are drawn, its features can then be used for more sophisticated data analysis or modeling, including machine learning.
